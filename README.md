# Interpreter in Racket
This project is for my Programming Languages and Paradigms class. The professor gave us a made-up language and asked us to write an interpreter for it in Racket. Here it is:

# The Interpreter
The program to be interpreted is passed as a list at the end of bnl.rkt. The BNF of the language is included in the accompanying PDF.

# What does BNL stand for?
Bruno's Nonsense Language.

# What's the point of this repository?
Honestly, I'm not sure. Maybe it will help some dummy like me in the future.
